# SmartiFi - Student Loans Platform


# What is SmartiFi?
SmartiFi is a student loans lending platform utilizing blockchain technology to store data securely on a network ran by Hyperledger Fabric. This network has been configured to our tastes to allow for lenders and students to logon and see the data they want to see. For the student, that is the loans avaliable in the network, loan payment dates, loan balances and much more additional data. Lenders are able to view their loan data, accept applicants and update requirements on their dashboard, giving them full control while utilizing the security of the network. Our major goal is to help students get through college with a lower interest rate and ultimately, less student loan debt.
